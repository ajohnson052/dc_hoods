## Summary

This project takes data that is available for Washington DC and organizes it by neighborhood. It was motivated by the notion that crime is often evaluated by geography while infrastructure is not. Additionally, I believe that neighborhood loyalty can be a great driver for positive social change.

## Technologies Used

* Ruby on Rails - backend framework
* Backbone.js - front-end framework
* PostgreSQL - database
* ActiveRecord - ORM
* HTTParty Gem - for backend data fetching
* Geokit Gem - for placing data points within neighborhoods on the backend
* jQuery - DOM manipulation
* Leaflet - basic map functionality
* Mapbox - map styling
* d3.js - for building out charts of data
* Bootstrap - front-end design framework
* animate.css - title animation
* Heroku - deployment

## Other Resources

* Ben Balter's aggregation of [DC data](https://github.com/benbalter/dc-maps/tree/master/maps)

## Future Development

At present this app is purely for viewing data, but the next version will facilitate conversations between neighbors. Users will be able to signup as a member of a neighborhood and post comments about improvements they would like to see. This will be a great platform for creating buzz about a topic and getting the attention of ANC commissioners.
